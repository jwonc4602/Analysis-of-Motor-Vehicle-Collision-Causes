## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation for their own projects associated with *Telling Stories with Data*. You do not need every aspect for every paper and you should delete aspects that you do not need.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean and test data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of this project were written with the assistance of the language model, ChatGPT. Specifically, ChatGPT was used to generate discussion points, refine the title and subtitle, and help structure key arguments. The entire chat history is available in other/llm/usage.txt.
